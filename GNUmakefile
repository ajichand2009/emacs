# This GNUmakefile is for GNU Make.  It is for convenience, so that
# one can run 'make' in an unconfigured source tree.  In such a tree,
# this file causes GNU Make to first create a standard configuration
# with the default options, and then reinvokes itself on the
# newly-built Makefile.  If the source tree is already configured,
# this file defers to the existing Makefile.

. :=

# If you want non-default build options, or if you want to build in an
# out-of-source tree, you should run 'configure' before running 'make'.
# But run 'autogen.sh' first, if the source was checked out directly
# from the repository.
